The first permanent settlement on the site of Jericho developed near the Ein es-Sultan spring between 9,500 and 9000 BCE.[27][28] As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed "Pre-Pottery Neolithic A" (abbreviated as PPNA). Its cultures lacked pottery, but featured the following:[citation needed]

small circular dwellings
burial of the dead under the floor of buildings
reliance on hunting of wild game
cultivation of wild or domestic cereals

At Jericho, circular dwellings were built of clay and straw bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about 5 metres (16 ft) across, and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.[30]


The 8000 BCE Tower of Jericho at Tell es-Sultan
The Pre-Sultan (c. 8350 – 7370 BCE)[dubious – discuss] is sometimes called Sultanian. The site is a 40,000 square metres (430,000 sq ft) settlement surrounded by a massive stone wall over 3.6 metres (12 ft) high and 1.8 metres (5 ft 11 in) wide at the base, inside of which stood a stone tower, over 8.5 metres (28 ft) high, containing an internal staircase with 22 stone steps[20][31] and placed in the centre of the west side of the tell.[32] This tower and the even older ones excavated at Tell Qaramel in Syria[33][34] are the oldest towers ever to be discovered. The wall of Jericho may have served as a defence against flood-water, with the tower used for ceremonial purposes.[35] The wall and tower were built during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period around 8000 BCE.[36][37] For the tower, carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that it was built around 8300 BCE and stayed in use until c. 7800 BCE.[32] The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, thus suggesting some kind of social organization.[citation needed] The town contained round mud-brick houses, yet no street planning.[38] The identity and number of the inhabitants of Jericho during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates going as high as 2,000–3,000, and as low as 200–300.[12][35] It is known that this population had domesticated emmer wheat, barley and pulses and hunted wild animals.[citation needed]
