Jericho's name in Modern Hebrew, Yeriẖo, is generally thought to derive from the Canaanite word rēḥ 'fragrant', but other theories hold that it originates in the Canaanite word Yaraḥ 'moon' or the name of the lunar deity Yarikh, for whom the city was an early centre of worship.[19]

Jericho's Arabic name, Arīḥā, means 'fragrant' and also has its roots in Canaanite Reaẖ.[20][21][22]
